1. It will print 3 to the console
2. It will print 150 to the console
3. It will print 150 to the console
4. It will return an array containing all the discounted prices, which is [50,100,150]
5. It will produce a ReferenceError, because "i" is defined in the scope of the for loop using "let", but called outside the loop where it's undefined.
6. It will produce a ReferenceError, because "discountedPrice" is defined in the scope of the for loop using "let", but called outside the loop where it's undefined.
7. It will print 150 to the console, because "finalPrice" is using let to defined at the beginning of the function, in this case it will be a function-scope variable, so console.log can print its value out.
8. It will return an array containing all the discounted prices, which is [50,100,150]
9. It will produce a ReferenceError, because "i" is defined in the scope of the for loop using "let", but called outside the loop where it's undefined.
10. It prints out 3, because length is using const to define in function scope and never modified again.
11. It will return an array containing all the discounted prices, which is [50,100,150]
12. A: let studentName = student.name; B: let gradYear = student['Grad Year']; C: student.greeting(); D: let favoriteTeacherName = student['Favorite Teacher'].name; E: let firstCourse = student.courseLoad[0];
13. '32'; 1; 3; '3null'; 4; 0; '3undefined'; NaN;
14. true; false; true; false; false; true;
15. '==' compares the value of two variables, if the data types are different, it will automatically convert the variables to the same data type of their corresponding values respectively. However, '===' will check for equality of both value and type, and doesn't do the data type conversion, it returns true if the type and values are both the same.

17. The result array is [2,4,6].For each iteration, the current element of the array (array[i]) is passed to the doSomething function, and it multiplies the value by 2 then returns back; after that, the returned value is pushed into newArr which eventually get returned. So, after all iterations, the result is [2,4,6].

19. The output will be 1 <br> 4 <br> 3<br> 2
